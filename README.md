# üöó Electronic Follow-Up

This is a practical mobile application built using **FlutterFlow** to help users monitor their vehicles in real time. The system connects to a chip installed in the car, which collects data (like engine status, mileage, etc.) and sends it to the app through service providers.

The app features a clear, user-friendly interface and includes a dashboard, detailed vehicle information, alerts, search & filtering options, user access control, and comprehensive reports.
